# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a version control software to manage code modifications. Github is a web host for code that is managed via git commands.

Researched answer: No significant differences between my and the researched answer.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: !!, Array.isArray, ==, ===, &&, ||, !=, !==, 

Researched answer: all of the above plus: Boolean(expression), new Boolean(expression).

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: index is the position of an element in an array/string. A value is the actual bit of information stored at that index.

Researched answer: index is a number that indicates where the location of information is stored in a JS object. That information can have a type called a value (primitive values).

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: They are the same in that they are some sort of container for elements and are 0 indexed. They are different in that the elements have to be separated by commas in an array, are surrounded by brackets ([]) and each element retains its data type. In strings, elements are surrounded by quotation marks ('', "", ``) and everything inside it has a data type of 'string.'

Researched answer: The main difference is that a string is a primitive data type, arrays can store any type of value or reference. They are also different in that they inherit from different prototypes i.e. the model in the background that determines their properties and behaviour is different.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Driver types and navigator keeps an eye out for mistakes to back up the driver. Navigator does most of the talking telling the driver exactly what to do gaging how much direction the driver needs and readjusting as necessary.

Researched answer: Driver and navigator work at the same computer station. Driver types the code while the navigator observes and provides strategic insight and back up when necessary. The role of the driver is more tactical while the navigator is more strategic. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A function which takes a function as an argument.

2. Jest: Testing suite for JS code.

3. Objects: Non-primitive data, aka reference data type that can hold an indefinite amount of code/data.

4. Method: A property of a JS object which holds a function that modifies the object it is called upon.

5. Classes: Code templates that can be instantiated (invoked, called) to create objects that will have access to the content in the class. That content can be functions that will act as a method to the object created, as well as variable definitions that will become properties of the object created.
